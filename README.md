# Numerical PDE Solver with Adaptive Mesh

Work-in-progress project. Goal: build a Python solver for 1D PDEs (advection–diffusion, Black–Scholes) using finite differences, then extend it with an adaptive moving mesh (r-adaptation).

## Plan

- Step 1: fixed uniform grid solver (explicit and implicit schemes)
- Step 2: validate with advection–diffusion equation
- Step 3: add adaptive moving mesh (monitor + equidistribution)
- Step 4: demo on option pricing (Black–Scholes)

## Status

Nothing implemented yet. This repo will track progress.
