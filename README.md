# Numerical PDE Solver with Adaptive Mesh

This project aims to develop a Python-based solver for one-dimensional partial differential equations using finite difference methods. The initial implementation will use a uniform grid, followed by an extension to an adaptive moving mesh (r-adaptation) to improve accuracy and efficiency. 

## Objectives
1. Implement a finite difference solver on a uniform mesh (explicit and implicit schemes).
2. Validate the solver on the advection–diffusion equation.
3. Incorporate an adaptive moving mesh using monitor functions and the equidistribution principle.
4. Demonstrate the approach on financial models such as the Black–Scholes equation.

## Current Status
The project is in the planning stage. Implementation has not yet started.
